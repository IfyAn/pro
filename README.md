# Crypto-Demoi
SETUP

I used expo framework, expo init my-demo

Tools
React Native(Expo)
React Native Navigation (Stack, BottomTam, Native)= For my navigations in the screen
@expo/vector-icons= For icons used

Areas you would like us to pay special attention to.
   I wasn't giving the necessary images, measurement and dimension for the project
   As for the CHART IMAGE in the project, it couldn't work on expo managed project because expo remove them or it wasn't compactible witth expo, so i used @expo/vector-icons as an image.


As for the project the HOMESCRTEEN will first appear, to navigate to the WALLETSCTREEN press (onPress) the DEPOSTE button while to open the modal in WalletScreen press(onPress) the ADA coin, a modal will pop up and the chart icon is to close ther modal
